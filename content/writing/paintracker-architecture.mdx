Clinical reality is not a clean workflow.
Pain and disability documentation is often created under stress, low energy, and low trust.

Most health tracking apps assume the opposite.

They assume account creation.
They assume always on sync.
They assume the user is willing to route intimate data through third party analytics and cloud storage.

That assumption is not neutral.
For many people it is dangerous.

PainTracker is built to reverse the power dynamic.

The user keeps authority.
The system remains usable when the network is absent.
The export is a deliberate action.

## Threat model in plain language

The primary threat is not a hacker fantasy.
The primary threat is institutional and interpersonal pressure.

An insurer asks for records.
A clinician dismisses symptoms.
A landlord demands proof of disability accommodations.
A partner demands access to a device.

A protective health journal must assume that the data can be used against the user.
So the architecture reduces the surface area.

## Design constraints

Low cognition operation
Capture the minimum useful signal with the fewest steps
Never punish partial entries

Degraded connectivity
Function offline
Preserve progress through interruptions
Avoid loading spinners as a dependency

Privacy as default
No telemetry by default
No central database requirement
No background sharing

Reversible sharing
Exports are explicit
A user can decide what to share and when

## Architecture

PainTracker uses a local first model.

Entries are stored on the device.
The app is usable without connectivity.
The core interaction is fast logging.

When the user needs a proof artifact, the system produces an export.

That export can be shared with a clinician or kept for personal continuity.
It is created by the user, not by a server.

This approach is not anti cloud.
It is pro boundary.

Cloud features can be added as optional modules.
But the base layer must remain protective.

## What makes it protective

A protective tool is quiet.

It does not force identity.
It does not require trust.
It does not collapse when a server fails.
It does not turn the body into an advertising profile.

It gives the user a stable interface to their own life.

## Proof surfaces

The dossier is the operational summary.
It contains the constraints and the architecture artifacts.
