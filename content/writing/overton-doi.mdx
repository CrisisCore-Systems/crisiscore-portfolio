Most software quietly assumes stability: continuous connectivity, spare cognition, safe environments, and institutions that respond.

Protective Computing treats those assumptions as hazards.

The Overton Framework is now DOI-backed so citations don’t rot and the canon stays checkable over time.

This framework is not affiliated with the political science concept of the Overton Window.

If you build systems that touch health, crisis response, legal aid, or coercion-risk environments, you want operational constraints — not motivational slogans.

## Why DOI backing matters

A framework without a stable record is easy to misquote and hard to audit.

DOI-backed publication gives you:

- Stable citation anchors
- Versioned source-of-record references
- A shared artifact collaborators can verify independently

This is especially important when trust is contested and your methods must survive external review.

## What this changes in practice

For teams building high-risk systems, DOI-backed canon means architecture debates can point to the same fixed baseline.

Instead of arguing from memory or screenshots, teams can reference a source that remains discoverable over time.

That reduces ambiguity during:

- Security and risk reviews
- Design handoffs across product and operations
- External audits and grant or procurement review

## How to use the canon

Use the canon as a layered set of constraints:

- Layer 1: foundational framework
- Layer 2: operational field translation
- Layer 3: measurement and audit rubric

If you can’t map a decision to one of those layers, your decision trail is likely too vague to defend.
